# APBD
### DATABASE APPLICATIONS
This repository contains projects I made for the APBD (Database Applications) course during studies on [PJAIT](https://pja.edu.pl/).

The project RevenueRecognitionApi is the final project for this course, uses JWT authorization and shows what I have learned during this class.
[RevenueRecognitionApi]([https://pja.edu.pl/](https://github.com/alessandra3747/APBD/tree/main/RevenueRecognitionApi)).
